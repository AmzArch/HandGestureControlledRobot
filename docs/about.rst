About
===========
Collaborative robots are a form of robotic automation built to work safely alongside human workers in a shared, collaborative workspace. In most applications, a collaborative robot is responsible for repetitive, menial tasks while a human worker completes more complex and thought-intensive tasks. The accuracy, uptime and repeatability of collaborative robots is designed to complement the intelligence and problem-solving skills of a human worker.

Collaborative robot designs differ greatly from their industrial robot counterparts. Featuring rounded edges, force limitations, and light weights, collaborative robots are first and foremost designed for safety. Most collaborative robots are equipped with a series of sensors to avoid collisions with human workers, as well as safety protocols to shut down if any form of unplanned contact occurs.

The ability to work collaboratively with humans greatly expands the potential applications of robotic automation. The market for collaborative robots is expected to experience exponential growth as more and more industries realize the profits to be gained from this technology.

With major market potential in a number of industries inside and outside of the factory setting, collaborative robots will be an exciting technology to keep an eye on as it becomes a prominent form of robotic automation.

With the above points in mind we set out to make a unique project that combines machine learning and AI with a moveable robotic platform such as a Turtlebot 4 built on the ROS2 platform to get it follow commands given by the user remotely using a webcam atached to a laptop and publish the commands over the ros network and subscribe to them in the Turtlebot 4.
