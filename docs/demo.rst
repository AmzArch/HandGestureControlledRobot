Elevator Pitch
----

Collaborative robots are designed to work safely alongside humans in a shared workspace, allowing humans to focus on complex tasks while robots perform repetitive tasks. Our project has combined machine learning and AI to create a unique collaborative robot, which can be controlled using hand gestures. The project uses a Turtlebot 4 running ROS2 Galactic, a RandomForrestCLassifier trained on hand gestures, and a webcam attached to a laptop/pc for gesture recognition. With its ability to recognize Numbers in American Sign Language, the robot can be remotely controlled with ease. This exciting technology can be deployed in a variety of industries, and you can try it out yourself by visiting the project's GitHub page.
